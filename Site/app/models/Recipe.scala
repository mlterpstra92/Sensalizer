/**
 * In this example we will create a simple table storing recipes.
 * Data modeling with com.websudos.phantom is trivial and covers some of the more advanced features of Cassandra.
 *
 * Phantom will auto-generate the CQL3 table definition from your Scala code.
 * And you can automatically insert the schema during tests or even live environments.
 *
 * This is a very straightforward example, with a non composite Partition key
